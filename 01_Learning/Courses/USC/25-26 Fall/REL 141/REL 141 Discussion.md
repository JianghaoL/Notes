### Ethnography

An "ethnography" is a research *method* for studying people (used in both anthropology and sociology). Derived etymologically from the Greek "*ethnos*" (people) and "*graphei*" (to write)

In practive, it is ofent a long-term immersive fieldwork project.

**2 Main Components**
1. **Participant Observation**: observing a community and their activities (and possibly taking part). Can involve interviewing, informal conversations, taking fieldnotes. Often an iterative process.
2. **Thick Description**: a written synthesis, interpretation or analysis.

>An ethnography is NOT equivalent to an interview or scientific report.

**Context-dependent**: "What does this thing/practive mean in *their* environment?
**Iterative**: You build *your* understanding through prolonged exposure and revisions of your own assumptions and question.
**Self-reflexive**: You account for how your own circumstances (identify, access, privilege, etc.) shaped what you saw, what you were told, and what you subsequently understood. (i.e. you take into account subject *and* object)

>A simple analogy: "reading" vs. "seeing"
