# CTIN 468 - Advanced Game Business

## 2026.1.26 - Chris Zukowski

Reviews * 30 = Copies sold
30,000 * $9 = Amount sold (gross)

> Look at the review counts

1000 + reviews = steam likes the game
500 - 999 = close to success
150 - 150 = well marketed but not liked
<150 = no visibility :(

Over 75% of the game on Steam has less than 50 review which are very unlikely to be hit games.

### How?

1. Right Genre
2. "Good" Quality
3. Accept the fact that the first game will *not* be great


> Start with small games
> Make them fast
> Move on
> 

***Likely to be Successful***
Friend Slop
Rage Game
Idle
Horror-Meta
Simulation
Autobattlers

> Focus more on genres that audience likes


### 4Ps
**Product** - Sandbox Game
**Place** - Steam
**Price** - $11
**Promotion** - TBD

> 90% is about "What game you make"

**Do Not Invest Everything in the First Game**
**Do Not Stop After the First Game**

75% of the games get 1,000 reviews in the same quater they are released.

The algorithm shows the game **a lot**. The only problem is that the game is NOT interesting.


### Most Indicative Metric

**Pre Phase**
Itch.IO

Views (under 418 :()

**Post Launch**
Money Earned

1st Q $150,000+


### Discount Strategy
If under $150,000 (Prolly doesn't matter lol)

If $150,000+:
*Be Careful and be Strategic*

1. Discount every chance you can (30 days)
2. Don't drop bellow 30% for a *long time*
3. Don't do a "history low" unless Valve gives you something like Daily Deal, Featuring

Minimum bar is a game with 18 years of prior development, perhaps equivalent to $200M today. :(

### Marketing

`CRM (customer relation management)` Built direct player relationships wherever possible; Brevo mailing list peaked around 250k.

`Community` Discord was the bedrock of the engaged community, but Kickstarter became an important channel, generating $2.5M.

`PR (public relations)` Generated a lot of press, and participated in a number of showcases - these were all the result of active effort.

`Co-marketing` Between influencers and esports, and brand partnerships like nVidia, Frost Giant expanded reach.

`Video` YouTube was the most active channel in terms of content production.

| Cultivated community | Sense of entitlement from participants |
| Generated positive press | Also drama and negative sentiment |
|Funded wider beta and collector's edition | Huge tax on the team |
