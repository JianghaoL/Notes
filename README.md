# Notes

Hello. Here in this folder structure, you can find virtually all stuff that I have been, am, and will be working on.

### Folders and What They Do

`Inbox` is where I jot down my random thoughts, pop-up ideas, and other misc things. It will be constantly updated and organized.

`Learning` is where the course or other study-related materials are located. Course notes can be found here.

`Projects` is where I keep my projects progress and related topics. There is `Active` and `[Archived]` folder which respectively holds projects that I am currently and actively working on and those that I have already finished.

`Ideas` is the folder for both my long or short-term ideas. They are inspirations I take from daily life and are likely to be turned into active projects.

`Knowledge` is a maintained library of knowledge. All essential concepts are kept in here for future reference.

`Reflections & Conclusions` is where I reflect on my past and current projects and ideas.
